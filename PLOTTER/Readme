This is a data/source code directory to make figures for 
JGR 2025JD043501R July 2025 Revision

We have cut and paste from the analysis source code(s) so as to make
the matlab plotting source codes (and matfiles), arranged in the order
of the 14 figures in main text and 3 figures in the appendices.

You cn either run the code individually in the Matlab worskpace eg
  clear all; make_jgr_fig7.m
or you can loop over them all by running
  clear all; driver_make_all.m

In either case, we suggest opening 4 matlab plot winows and arrange
them in a 2x2 tile fashion
    Fig 1    |    Fig 2
    ---------|---------
    Fig 3    |    Fig 4

After making the individual panels for any one figure, we print them
as png or pdf and then use "imagemagick" on a Mac to combine the
panels for submission to JGR eg 
  gm montage -trim -geometry 1200x950+10+10 -tile 2x1  fig3a.pdf  fig3b.pdf   fig3_merged.pdf
