This is a data/source code directory to make figures for JGR 2025JD043501R

We have cut and paste from the analysis source code(s) so as to make
the matlab source codes here, arranged in the order of the 14 figures
in main text and 3 figures in the appendices.

Typically after making the individual panels, we use "imagemagick" on
a Mac to combine the panels for submission to JGR

eg gm montage -trim -geometry 1200x950 -tile 2x1  fig3a.pdf  fig3b.pdf   fig3_merged.pdf
